# **App Name**: Classroom Checkmate

## Core Features:

- Student Selection: Allow students to select their name from a dropdown list.
- Location Selection: Provide a set of predefined locations (e.g., library, restroom, etc.) for students to select as their destination.
- Check-in Time Recording: Record the check-in time when a student selects their name and destination.
- Check-out Time Recording: Record the check-out time when a student checks back in.
- Activity Log: Display a simple log showing the check-in/check-out history for the current day.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean look.
- Secondary color: Maroon (#800000) for backgrounds and subtle accents.
- Accent: Dark Gold (#B8860B) for interactive elements like buttons and selection highlights.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Simple, recognizable icons for locations and actions (check-in/check-out).
- A clean, single-page layout with clear sections for check-in, check-out, and activity log.
- Subtle animations (e.g., a fade-in effect) for check-in/check-out confirmations.

## Original User Request:
I would like to create a web app that allows students to check in and out of a classroom. The students should be able to select where they are going and the system should record what time they check in and check out.
